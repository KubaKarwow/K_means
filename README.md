# K_means

K-means Clustering for Irises
Description
The program performs the k-means clustering algorithm for iris data, ignoring the decision attribute. The user inputs the value of k (number of clusters), and the program displays at each iteration the sum of squared distances from their centroids. At the end, it shows the cluster compositions along with their entropy by species.

Implementation
Language: Java


Libraries: No external ML libraries used, implementation from scratch
